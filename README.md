## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

- Flexbox:
I develeoped a deeper understanding of flex box and how elements need to be created in order to stay responsive all while respecting the styling in place.

- Z-index:
Z index was something that I had barely used before this project and now I understand how it can help with the positioning of elements.

- Opacity:
Another element that I had hardly used before. This allowed me to alter how the image looks to signal when it has been clicked on.

### Continued development

From here I think it would be best to continue to develop my front end skills by learning a JS and CSS framework.

One problem that I came across was that it was hard to manage the project as it began to grow - especially the CSS. The best approach would be like a 'birds eye view' where I have an overview of how elements will interact with each other and then can write functions in JS that can be reused instead of repeating myself.

Holding myself accountable for the time I spend on each part of the project is also extremely important.
